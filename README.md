# Insurance-Data-Warehouse
- CSE companyâ€™s enterprise data warehouse combines 98% of business data in a clean and normalized way. There are 25 fact tables, 100 dimensions including 7 SCD2 dimensions and 50+ tables for dashboards and data feeds.
- The data are available in AWS Redshift for ad-hoc queries and used in 200+ Tableau dashboards, SSRS reports, numerous data feeds and data calls.
- The original data warehouse structure and ETL processes were created by 4Sight (a third-party vendor). It appears that it was initially designed for a tiny insurance company and later adapted to be more generalized for any insurance company. I did not receive any support or assistance from the vendor.
- The basic solution was substantially enhanced and tailored to meet the specific requirements of CSE.
